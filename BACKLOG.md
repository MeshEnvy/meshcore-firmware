# Envycore backlog

Canonical queue for **MeshEnvy firmware work** in this repo. Each item gets its own `feature/<name>` branch, its own bench gate, and merges to `envyos/main` **only when you explicitly pull it from the backlog**. Distro semver is chosen at publish time in `envyos/envyos17/`.

Enterprise index: `ops/initiatives/envyos-backlog.md` (summary rows only).

## How to use

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **ID** | Stable backlog ID (`EC-###`) |
| **Priority** | P0 field blocker; P1 high leverage; P2 polish; Icebox deferred |
| **Effort** | S / M / L / XL desk or bench days |
| **Depends** | Other EC IDs whose branch must merge to `envyos/main` first |
| **Status** | `backlog` · `in_progress` · `bench` · `merged_main` · `published` · `icebox` |

**`merged_main` means git-merged to `envyos/main` only.** It is not field flash, not a distro publish, and not an upstream PR merge.

### Upstream PR branches (pure track — optional, not merged to main)

| ID | Branch | PR base | Notes |
|----|--------|---------|-------|
| EC-000 | `feature/defer-remote-cli-upstream` | meshcore-dev `dev` | On origin; open cross-fork PR when ready |

## Log

| Date | Note |
|------|------|
| 2026-08-25 | Opened backlog; split `envyos/dev-pre-split` monolith into feature branches. **`envyos/main` stays on v1.16 + 0.1.3 hotfix** until items are pulled deliberately. |
| 2026-08-25 | Reverted mistaken merge of EC-001–EC-009 to `envyos/main`. Feature branches only. |
| 2026-08-25 | EC-011: repeater `stealth_mode` — gate self-adverts, anon owner/region/clock, node discover, OTA beacons; path hash on relay remains. |
| 2026-08-25 | EC-012: OTA release provenance — sign published motas, fleet `ota key` allowlist, apply trust separate from discovery (EC-011). |
